# B453camp369

B453camp369 [:leet_speak:] is a Python console application designed to manage autonomous agents. It offers secure API connections to various communication tools and machine learning methods. In its core function, B453camp369 stores encrypted secrets and maintains the state of all autonomous agents' properties. It operates at ISO8 level with a Human in the Loop providing the local key file.

This project is unrelated to the Basecamp project management tool.

## Architecture

The architecture of B453camp369 is composed of the following layers:

1. **Autonomous Agent Manager (Basecamp)**: Handles `Signal Support for Agents`, starts and stops autonomous agents. SDHS=>Slow Down High Speed
2. **Autonomous Agents (Bots)**: These are bot managers that start Discord and Telegram bots, handle communication between APIs, modulate with advanced tools, and secure their own secrets using keys from Basecamp. BOT=>Be On Time
3. **Auto-bots**: These are Python methods that perform work, listen for communications, and pass secrets between APIs. HUAW=>Hurry Up and Wait

## Future Direction

We are currently exploring the best Python console frameworks that include asyncio task management. We're considering Prompt Toolkit, Textual, Asyncclick, Typer among others. If you have any suggestions or experience with these tools, or alternative recommendations, we welcome your input. ALT Path: Start over using Modular.Mojo.ðŸ”¥.
